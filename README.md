# CSCI124-CH12PEXS
Programming Exercise from Chapter 12 of from C++ Programming: From Problem Analysis to Program Design by D.S. Malik
## Only One Auto Grader Test This Week
Your assignment is to use the online textbook readings to create a functional copy of Example 12-9 in the textbook.  
This task will be manually graded and is worth 8 points (one for each .h and .cpp file you have to fill in).  
The auto-grader test is only worth 2 points.
*You can find the start of Example 12-9 on p. 48 of the Chapter 12 pdf OR p. 828 of the printed book*  
### What is given to you:  
- All files you need have been created, but some of them will require you to copy/paste code from the text.
- Chapter 10, 11, and 12 on Blackboard to use as a reference.  
- **main.cpp** has been provided and fixed for you
### What you are expected to do:  
- Go back through the readings.  What do you need from earlier chapters to make this program work?
- Fill in **employeeType.h** and **employeeTypeImp.cpp** using code found in the textbook chapters.
- Fill in **fullTimeEmployee.h** and **fullTimeEmployeeImp.cpp** using code found in the textbook chapters.
- Fill in **partTimeEmployee.h** and **partTimeEmployeeImp.cpp** using code found in the textbook chapters.
- Fill in **personType.h** and **personTypeImp.cpp** using code found in the textbook chapters.
- **Note:** You should NOT have to write any original code.  You should be able to make this program work by copy/pasting directly from the book into the templates provided.  You should also NOT have to erase any of the provided code.  

### How to compile and run:  
Enter this line to compile:  
*g++ main.cpp personTypeImp.cpp employeeTypeImp.cpp fullTimeEmployeeImp.cpp partTimeEmployeeImp.cpp -o program*  
Followed by this line to run:  
*./program*
